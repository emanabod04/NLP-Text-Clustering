# NLP-Text-Clustering
**Abstract**:
Text clustering is the task of grouping a set of unlabeled texts in such a 
way that texts in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to 
those in other clusters. Having a number of documents extracted from 
five Gutenberg books of different genres, this report discusses the 
methodologies and models with different transformation techniques that 
have been applied to these documents to see if the natural clusters could 
be extracted out of these data one more time
